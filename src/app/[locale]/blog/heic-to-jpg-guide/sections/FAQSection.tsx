    {
      question: 'Does converting HEIC to JPG lose quality?',
      answer: 'Minimal quality loss. Our converter uses high-quality settings to preserve image quality while converting to the more compatible JPG format.',

      question: 'Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?',
      answer: 'Currently one file at a time for best quality. The process is very quickâ€”just a few seconds per image.',
