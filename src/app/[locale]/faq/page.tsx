  {
    question: 'How does browser-based processing work?',

      'All file processing happens entirely in your web browser using JavaScript and Web APIs. When you upload a file, it stays on your device and is processed locally. This means faster processing and complete privacy since no files are sent to our servers.',
    category: 'Privacy & Security',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are my files secure and private?',
    answer:
      'Yes, your files are completely secure. Since all processing happens in your browser, no files are uploaded to our servers. We cannot access, view, or store your files. Your data never leaves your device.',
    category: 'Privacy & Security',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to my files after conversion?',
    answer:
      'Your files remain on your device throughout the entire process. After conversion, you download the result directly from your browser. Nothing is stored on our servers because nothing was uploaded in the first place.',
    category: 'Privacy & Security',

  {
    question: 'Is there a file size limit?',

    category: 'Features',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I convert multiple files at once?',
    answer:

    category: 'Features',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need an internet connection?',
    answer:
      'You need an internet connection to load the website initially. After the page loads, the tools can work offline since all processing happens in your browser. However, features like AI image generation require an active internet connection.',

    category: 'PDF Tools',
  },
  {
    question: 'What color tools are available?',

  {
    question: 'How does the AI image generator work?',
    answer:
      'Our AI image generator uses advanced AI models to create images from text descriptions. Simply describe what you want to see, and the AI will generate an image based on your prompt. This feature requires an active internet connection.',
